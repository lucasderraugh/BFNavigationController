### Readme

This is basically an approach to bring the popular UINavigationController to Mac OS X.

This version is a fork of the original that implements animated views instead of view flattening. If for example your view would like to make an animation before it dissapears or an animation while it's appearing in, then you now have the option to do so.

### Installation

Include all files manually or add the following to your podfile:

```Ruby
pod 'BFNavigationController'
```

## How it works

BFNavigationController is easy to use and works almost exactly like a UINavigationController. All method names (and respective functionalities) have been derived from UINavigationController. You can therefore just look into 
Apple's UIKit online documentation (http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UINavigationController_Class/Reference/Reference.html) for further references.

In contrast to their iOS counterparts, Mac apps should of course be more flexible when it comes to custom window sizes and layouts. Hence, you can intialize your BFNavigationController by providing an NSRect:


	_navigationController = [[BFNavigationController alloc] initWithFrame: YOUR_RECT rootViewController: YOUR_VIEW_CONTROLLER];
	[_window.contentView addSubview: _navigationController.view];


Navigation- and toolbars haven't been implemented yet. However, you can easily hook in some custom bars. 
Setting a BFNavigationControllerDelegate and implementing the methods `-navigationController:willShowViewController:animated:` and `-navigationController:didShowViewController:animated:` 
could be the perfect way to do this.
